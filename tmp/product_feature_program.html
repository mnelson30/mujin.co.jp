<h2>Manufacturer-specific Program Output</h2>

<p>After a trajectory's accuracy is assured by VRC or other simulation on the MUJIN Controller, it gets converted into native files for a particular robot manufacturer. Currently DENSO and MITSUBISHI are supported on the MUJIN Controller. The user copies this program and pastes it into the robot manufacturers program connected to a real robot. The user can immediately move the robot.</p>
