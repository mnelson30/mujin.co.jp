<h2>Vision</h2>

<h4>Started from Open Source Software </h4>
<p>
  MUJIN Inc. was founded in 2011 in Tokyo, Japan by Issei Takino and the world-renowned roboticist, Dr. Rosen Diankov, the main contributor of the widely used robot manipulation planning platform OpenRAVE.</p>
<br/>
<p>
  As a natural transition from being focused on the development of a world-class open-source software for programming autonomous multi-joint robots over the past five years till 2011, Dr. Diankov and the team at MUJIN now address robot makers, robot users, and research institutions around the world.

<h4>MUJIN goes to industry </h4>

 <p>{% blocktrans %}In the many fields our technology can be applied to, MUJIN's main target is Factory Automation (FA) using industrial robots. The demand for factory automation using industrial robots has become greater than ever and continues to grow. However, the systems integration process posses a big obstacle to people, because it requires highly specialized skills and is time-consuming. Providing a large range of solutions, from stand-alone to fully integrated services, we strive to help robot system integraters to work more effectively, shorten the development and deployment cycle, and increase overall manufacturing performance.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
<br/>
<p>
  MUJIN's mission is to achieve our vision of =Industrial Robots for Everyone=. We believe that easy access to industrial robots is key to promoting factory automation and increasing worldwide manufacturing productivity.
