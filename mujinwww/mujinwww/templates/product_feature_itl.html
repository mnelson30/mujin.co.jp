  <p>{% trans "Industrial Task Language is a robot programming language developed by MUJIN, which enables users to conveniently program and design on their robotic applications. ITL is completely indenpendent to any robot manufactures' and designed to maximize MUJIN Controller's extensive simulation features. Using ITL release people from managing differnt robot program languages dependent on manufactures'and reduce the effort required to plan, apply and maintain core robotic exercises, saving time and expenditure." %}</p>
