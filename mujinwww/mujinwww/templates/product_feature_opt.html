  <p class="lead">{% trans "In order to enable our customers to discover the most optimal robot and workcell layout, the MUJIN Controller supports several types of optimizations. An optimization will take one or more bodies (robot or other objects) in an environment and examine all possible positions and trajectories for a given task. It automatically finds the environment states that best corresponds to fast task times." %}</p>

  <p class="lead">{% trans "For example, an optimization could move the robot around its environment in attempts to discover the most optimal position given the task. The MUJIN Controller will evaluate thousands of robot positions and orientations, and for each robot placement it solves for an optimal motion plan. In the end, the user is left with the robot locations that yielded the fastest task times." %}</p>

  <p class="lead">{% trans "Additionally, the same optimization could also have been run against the position of the target workpiece object as well. The optimization would then have simultaneously considered all the positions of the robot and target object. In summary, optimizations allow users of the MUJIN Controller to calculate the optimum body positions to maximize efficiency of a workcell." %}</p>
