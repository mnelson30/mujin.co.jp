Easy and quick 3D scans for parts and environments: ''
? MUJIN Scanner is the ideal choice for those who require a quick, easy and simple
  3d scan of an object or environment. It captures objects quickly with handheld 3D
  sensor, which allows for almost unlimited applications.
: ''
? MUJIN Scanner is similar to a video camera that captures objects in 3D, and it has
  been developed specifically for robot simulation applications. Scanning can be competed
  in only a minute and the generated 3D model is relatively simple, so it can be imported
  into many different kinds of robot simulators immediately.
: ''
? Because the MUJIN Scanner does not require marker or turntable, it does not limit
  the object size or location. You can carry the scanner around the factory and scan
  various kind of objects wherever and whenever you need to.

MUJIN Pick Worker: ''
World first motion planning bin-picking system: ''
? By registering 3D models objects in advance, the robot automatically generates collision
  and singularity free motions between picking and suppyling locations. Additionally,
  grasp sets for the objects are pre-computed, so parts can be picked up in many different
  ways. This innovative technology enables a very flexible, smooth and fast system
  for a robot to pick objects from inside of a bin.
: ''
The added value of motion planning: ''
? Since all robot motions are outputted by the MUJIN Controller, robot motions are
  usually very smooth. This smooth motion could reduce damages for fragile or sensitive
  products.
: ''
Simple but flexible: ''
? The brilliance of the Pick Worker system lies in its software. However, it was built
  with a minimal number of components such as the robot, slider, camera, and the MUJIN
  Controller. By keeping the hardware simple, it reduces the possibility for mechanical
  failure and opens up possibility for flexable and easy modifications based on customers'
  request.

The MUJIN Controller is our innovative solution to industrial robot programming: ''
Dramatically improves the existing expensive and complicated robot integration processes: ''
Allows a user to specify desired robot tasks in an intuitive user interface: ''
Automatically generates collision-free motion plans considering the user-specified task constraints: ''
Provides robot placement optimizations: ''
Saves precious design, testing, and deployment time while increasing productivity in common industrial robotics tasks: ''
Simplifies deployment and testing of hard programming tasks like dual-arm manipulation: ''
Simulation Precision and Accuracy: ''
? A simulation is pointless unless it is consistent with the reality. Most existing
  simulation tools have difficulty with ensuring that a planned trajectory matches
  up with the robot's motion in reality. MUJIN however is proud to guarantee our trajectories
  to at least 95%% precision. What the program shows on the computer is what will
  happen in the actual robot cell.

No CAD Dependencies: ''
? Inverse kinematics is used to determine the joint parameters that provide a desired
  position of the end-effector. Traditionally, the kinematic equations to solve the
  IK of a robot can be difficult and tedious to work with. Various numerical techniques
  exist to approximate analytical solutions, but the algorithms are usually lacking
  in speed or accuracy.
: ''
? Here at MUJIN, we have developed tools that can automatically solve the analytic
  inverse kinematics equations and generate extremely robust and fast programs to
  find solutions. MUJIN's framework supports any robot or kinematic structure, even
  if it involves more than 7 axes or closed kinematic chains.
: ''
Automated Collision Avoidance System: ''
? Most existing industrial robot programming packages can only check for collisions
  with the workpiece and robot. They require users to manually specify collision-free
  waypoints so trajectories will never have collisions in them. The problem with this
  technique is that the waypoints users choose will most certainly yield sub-optimal
  trajectories.
: ''
? The MUJIN Controller approaches things differently. All collision avoidance and
  constraint handling happens automatically based on simulations and path planning
  algorithms based on the robot and its environment. It takes a lot of stress off
  the robot programmer as it provides a clean and simple interface that requires only
  high-level parameters as input.
: ''
Advantages: ''
Eliminates the need for manual teaching operations, which reduces development and deployment cost.: ''
Creates motion plans for tasks that are very difficult or impossible to program with manual teaching.: ''
Example Task: ''
This task would have been very difficult to program without automatic collision avoidance.: ''
Example Workflow: ''
? Collision avoidance enables a drastically simplified workflow for robot programmers
  and system integrators when approacing the complex task of programming a robot.
: ''
? Import 3D models into the MUJIN Controller. The MUJIN Controller supports many 3D
  CAD software, so there is no need to buy a new 3D CAD systems or licenses.
: ''
? With <a href="{{ site.baseurl_root }}{{ site.lang }}/product_feature_itl">MUJIN
  ITL</a> users have a high-level, generic way to easily specify task parameters such
  as tool, task type and goals. In this case, users only specify tool position when
  it grab the chair (P1) and tool position in final destination (P2).
: ''
! 'The only program you write is:': ''
? Sit back and relax while the MUJIN Controller chooses the best trajectory by comparing
  thousands of candidate trajectories. After calculating the most optimal trajectory,
  MUJIN Controller automatically output robot manufactures program.
: ''
? A simulation is pointless unless it is consistent with reality. Most existing simulation
  tools have difficulty with ensuring that a planned trajectory in a virtual environment
  matches up exactly with the robot's motion in the real world. MUJIN however is proud
  to guarantee our trajectories are accurate and precise to at least 95 percent of
  the real robot's motion.
: ''
Virtual Robot Controller (VRC): ''
? To achieve our high simulation accuracy the MUJIN Controller examines all trajectories
  calculated through a robot manufacture's Virtual Robot Controller (VRC). This means
  that their simulation software verifies the MUJIN Controller generated trajectory.
  Only collision free trajectories proven by the test with VRC is output as a result.
: ''
Grasp and Release Function: ''
? The MUJIN Controller has an unique function which can simulate trajectories while
  considering a workpiece in the robots grasp. As soon as a robot grabs an object,
  the MUJIN Controller treats that object as a part of the robot. This means the objects
  will be part of the robots collision mesh and respond to collision avoidance, so
  that users do not have to specify intermediate waypoints to account for the object
  being in a specific place while being manipulated by the robot.
: ''
? Once the tool is specified, the robot can grab the workpiece, transfer it to its
  goal and release it without adjusting any parameters. Multiple workpieces and tools
  can be chained in one task to form complex assembles.
: ''
? The MUJIN Controller has a function which can optimize grasp out of specified grasp
  sets. After the user specified possible grasp sets for the workpiece, MUJIN Controller
  automatically simulates all possible task trajectory and tells you which grasp set
  is the most suitable for the task.
: ''
? In order to enable our customers to discover the most optimal robot and workcell
  layout, the MUJIN Controller supports several types of optimizations. An optimization
  will take one or more bodies (robot or other objects) in an environment and examine
  all possible positions and trajectories for a given task. It automatically finds
  the environment states that best corresponds to fast task times.
: ''
? For example, an optimization could move the robot around its environment in attempts
  to discover the most optimal position given the task. The MUJIN Controller will
  evaluate thousands of robot positions and orientations, and for each robot placement
  it solves for an optimal motion plan. In the end, the user is left with the robot
  locations that yielded the fastest task times.
: ''
? This layout is before optimizing robot position. You can see that the robot perfectly
  avoids all obstacles, but there may be better trajectory in better position.
: ''
? This layout is after optimizing robot position. you can see that robot position
  and angle apparently changed and those should be difficult to be found by manual
  teaching. In this case, placement optimization save 40% of task time.
: ''
? Additionally, the same optimization could also have been run against the position
  of the target workpiece object as well. The optimization would then have simultaneously
  considered all the positions of the robot and target object. In summary, optimizations
  allow users of the MUJIN Controller to calculate the optimum body positions to maximize
  efficiency of a workcell.
: ''
Clearance Setting Function: ''
? The MUJIN Controller has an unique function which can set a clearance distance between
  robot and obstacles. Since each customer should have desired clearance amount for
  their safety, MUJIN Controller tries to sutisfy the contstrain as much as it can.
  However, robot sometimes to approach to obstacles or goals to accomplish specified
  task. When the task cannot be accomplished with specified clearance amount, MUJIN
  controller automatically reduces the amount of clearance and tries to complete the
  task.
: ''
Clearance setting 30mm: ''
Clearance setting 60mm: ''
Multi-Robot Manipulation Planning System: ''
? Most robot simulation packages consider just a single robot and are not configured
  to simultaneously compute solutions for multiple robots. Because of this handicap,
  robot programmers have a difficult time producing non-colliding motions for robots
  moving in the same workspace.
: ''
The speed benefits of multiple robots in an assembly task.: ''
? To solve these problems, MUJIN has leveraged algorithms for collision-free motion
  plans for multiple robots in the same environment. Furthermore, the MUJIN Controller
  makes it possible to optimize the combined locations of all robots involved in the
  task. Customers would be able to use multiple robots together in an assembly line,
  which can result in a substantial gain in productivity. MUJIN Controller can also
  optimize for cell-manufacturing where a dual-arm robot performs a complex assembly
  task.
: ''
Industrial Task Language (ITL): ''
? Industrial Task Language is a robot programming language developed by MUJIN. It
  enables users to conveniently program and design their robotic applications in a
  generic and scalable way. ITL is completely independent to any robot manufactures'
  language and is designed to maximize MUJIN Controller's extensive simulation features.
  Using ITL releases people from managing different robot programs in different languages
  that depend on manufactures'. It also reduces the effort required to plan, apply
  and maintain core robotic programming techniques, saving time and money.
: ''
Specify only goals: ''
? Since the MUJIN Controller is a tool designed to create the optimized, collision
  free paths, an ITL user only has to specify goals.
: ''
Example Program: ''
Manufacturer-specific Program Output: ''
? After a trajectory's accuracy is assured by VRC or other simulation on the MUJIN
  Controller, it gets converted into native files for a particular robot manufacturer.
  Currently DENSO and MITSUBISHI are supported on the MUJIN Controller. The user copies
  this program and pastes it into the robot manufacturers program connected to a real
  robot. The user can immediately move the robot.
: ''
? ! 'The MUJIN Controller does not require users to install any software. The only
  requirement is a web browser. MUJIN strongly recommends the following browsers:'
: ''
Standalone 3D CAD Format Support: ''
? Many of existing robot simulation software are implemented as add-on's to expensive
  3D CAD software. Purchasing new 3D CAD software licenses can be expensive. The MUJIN
  Controller does not require any specific 3D CAD software and the robot programmer
  can easily import 3D models in most common formats.

: ''
Robot Motion Planning: ''
Motion planning is used to avoid collision obstacles while optimizing the robot task time.: ''
Multiple Robot Motion Planning: ''
? Motion planning for multiple robots. Task time for one robot is 16.6s, adding two
  in the same environment decreases task time by 25%.
: ''

  position of a manipulator. MUJIN can solve the analytic robot inverse kinematics
  equations and generate extremely robust and fast programs to find solutions. MUJIN's
  framework supports any robot structure, even if it involves closed links.
: ''
Parallelized Layout Optimization: ''
? Optimizing the robot placement and other objects in the workspace can quickly cut
  the total task time <b>by 25%</b>. However layout and robot optimizations are very
  computationally intensive and can take days to finish for one task.Fortunately,
  MUJIN technology can take advantage of today's parallel processing and multi-core
  CPUs to shrink the computation time to under 10 minutes with the MUJIN Controller.
