<p class="lead">{% trans "A simulation is pointless unless it is consistent with reality. Most existing simulation tools have difficulty with ensuring that a planned trajectory in a virtual environment matches up exactly with the robot's motion in the real world. MUJIN however is proud to guarantee our trajectories are accurate and precise to at least 95 percent of the real robot's motion." %}</p>
<h3>{% trans "Virtual Robot Controller (VRC) " %}</h3>
<p class="lead">{% trans "To achieve our high simulation accuracy the MUJIN Controller examines all trajectories calculated through a robot manufacture's Virtual Robot Controller (VRC). This means that their simulation software verifies the MUJIN Controller generated trajectory. Only collision free trajectories proven by the test with VRC is output as a result." %}</p>
